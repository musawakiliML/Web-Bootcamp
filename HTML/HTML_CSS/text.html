    <p>In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that 
        appears on your pages. You will learn about:</p>
    <p>● <strong>Structural markup:</strong>the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs  </p>
    <p>● <strong>Semantic markup:</strong> which provides extra information; such 
        as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
        you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the 
        meaning of acronyms, and so on.</p>

    <h1>Headings</h1>
    <p>We have 6 headings in HTML H1-H6. Below are the examples:</p>
    <h1>Heading 1 with h1 tag </h1>
    <h2>Heading 2 with h2 tag</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3 with h3 tag</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4 with h4 tag</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5 with h5 tag</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6 with h6 tag</h6>

    <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>A Paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>

    <h1>Bold & Italics</h1>
    <p>You can make a text Bold usin the b tag: <b>Love</b> </p>
    <p>You can make a text appear italics using the i tag <i> I miss you </i> </p>

    <h1>Superscript & Subscript</h1>
    <p>Sometime you have an equation or suffixes in your text, you can use the -sup- tag for Superscript </p>
    <p>Example: E=MC<sup>2</sup> for the energy equation.</p>
    <p>For the sub tag you display Subscript used in chemical formulae.</p>
    <p>Example:H<sub>2</sub>O for the water formulae</p>

    <p>WhiteSpace is generally discarded when included in the text.</p>

    <h1>Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules</h1>
    <p>
        When writing long paragraphs sometimes you need to break the sentences, and start on another line and you need a divider for sections. This is where the br tag and hr tag comes in.
    </p>

    <p>This Sentence has br in it:- As you have already seen, the browser will automatically <br/> show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. <br/>But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />.</p>
    <p>Now we willuse the hr to divide the sections</p>
