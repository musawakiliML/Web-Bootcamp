    <h2>Understanding Text in HTML</h2>
    <h3>Objectives:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Headings and Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Bold, Italic, Emphasis</li>
        <li>Structural and Semantic Markup</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that 
        appears on your pages. You will learn about:</p>
    <p>● <strong>Structural markup:</strong>the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs  </p>
    <p>● <strong>Semantic markup:</strong> which provides extra information; such 
        as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
        you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the 
        meaning of acronyms, and so on.</p>

    <h1>Headings</h1>
    <p>We have 6 headings in HTML H1-H6. Below are the examples:</p>
    <h1>Heading 1 with h1 tag </h1>
    <h2>Heading 2 with h2 tag</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3 with h3 tag</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4 with h4 tag</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5 with h5 tag</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6 with h6 tag</h6>

    <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>A Paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>

    <h1>Bold & Italics</h1>
    <p>You can make a text Bold usin the b tag: <b>Love</b> </p>
    <p>You can make a text appear italics using the i tag <i> I miss you </i> </p>

    <h1>Superscript & Subscript</h1>
    <p>Sometime you have an equation or suffixes in your text, you can use the -sup- tag for Superscript </p>
    <p>Example: E=MC<sup>2</sup> for the energy equation.</p>
    <p>For the sub tag you display Subscript used in chemical formulae.</p>
    <p>Example:H<sub>2</sub>O for the water formulae</p>

    <p>WhiteSpace is generally discarded when included in the text.</p>

    <h1>Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules</h1>
    <p>
        When writing long paragraphs sometimes you need to break the sentences, and start on another line and you need a divider for sections. This is where the br tag and hr tag comes in.
    </p>

    <p>This Sentence has br in it:- As you have already seen, the browser will automatically <br/> show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. <br/>But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />.</p>
    <p>Now we will use the hr to divide the sections</p>
    <hr/>

    <h1>Strong & Emphasis</h1>
    <p>You can make word stand our using the Strong tag to show its importance</p>
    <p><Strong>Beware:</Strong> The Dogs are active at Night...</p>
    <p>You can indicate emphasis on al element using the em tag</p>
    <p>I <em>think</em> i love competitive programming more that chess.</p>

    <h1>Quotations</h1>
    <p>We have 2 major used tags blockquote and q tags</p>
    <p>Blockquoyte Example:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Winnie-the-Pooh">
        <p>
            Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Quote Example:</p>
    <p>As A.A. Milne said,<q>Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That's the problem.</q></p>

    <h1>Abbreviations & Acronyms</h1>
    <p>You can use Abbreviations and acronyms in html using the abbr for both in html5</p>
