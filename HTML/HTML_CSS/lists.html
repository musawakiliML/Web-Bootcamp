    <h5>There 3 different types of lists in HTML:</h5>
    <p> <b>Ordered lists</b> are lists where each item in the list is 
        numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
        a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
        where each point needs to be identified by a section 
        number.</p>
    <br/>
    <p> <b>Unordered lists</b> are lists that begin with a bullet point 
        (rather than characters that indicate order).</p>
    <br/>
    <p> <b>Definition lists</b> are made up of a set of terms along with the 
        definitions for each of those terms.</p>
    <br/>

    <h1>Ordered Lists</h1>
    <p>The Ordered lists are created usng the ol tag</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <h4>Recipe for cooking Jollof rice</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>
        <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
    </ol>
